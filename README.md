# biro
BiRO, the Bibliographic Reference Ontology, is an ontology structured according to the FRBR model to define bibliographic records (as subclasses of frbr:Work) and bibliographic references (as subclasses of frbr:Expression), and their compilations into bibliographic collections such as library catalogues, and into bibliographic lists such as reference lists in journal articles, respectively.
